# Learning Angular 17 features
This project was to learn and test new angular features and functionalities

**Achievements**
* Change detections through signals
* Control flows using signals and computed signals
* New Angular Directives like @difer, @if, @for, @switch, @empty, @placeholder
* Guards implementaton through functions to improve performance
* Standalone components
* View transition animation
* Tailwind

  ***Demo***
  * Through signals Angular is able to detect when a value has changed and show it directly to the user in real-time

  * Making an "infinite" loop to create a heavy component I tested how Angular is able to solve these situations with @defer directive

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
